Excel-Analysis with fine amout of datas


**Objectives**

1. **Understand Salary Distributions**: The primary goal of this project is to analyze the salary distributions across various job titles in the data science and engineering fields.
2. **Compare Salaries by Country**: Assess how salaries vary across different countries for the same job roles, highlighting any significant differences or trends.
3. **Evaluate Impact of Experience**: Determine how different experience levels (entry, mid, senior, executive) affect the average salary across various job roles.
4. **Analyze Yearly Trends**: Identify any changes in salary trends over different years, providing insights into salary growth or decline within the industry.
5. **Visualize Data**: Utilize visual tools to effectively communicate findings, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the data and trends.

**What We Did**

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: The data was collected from a reliable source, potentially including job boards, salary surveys, or company reports. The data was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency, removing any outliers or errors.
2. **Data Segmentation**: The dataset was segmented by various categories, including job title, company location, work year, and experience level.
3. **Analysis and Visualization**:
    - **Average Salary by Job Title**: The first image presents a line graph showing the average salary for different data science and engineering roles, segmented by country. It helps to compare salaries for roles such as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, ML Engineer, etc., across countries like Germany.
    - **Salary Distribution by Country**: The second image displays a bar graph showing the average salaries by country, allowing for a comparison of salary levels across different regions.
4. **Filtering Options**: Filters are provided for users to select specific years, experience levels, and countries to dynamically update the visuals and get tailored insights.

**Outcomes**

1. **Identified Salary Disparities**: The analysis highlighted significant disparities in salaries for the same job roles across different countries, showcasing how location significantly impacts compensation.
2. **Experience-Based Insights**: The study demonstrated how experience levels (entry to executive) impact salaries within the data science and engineering fields, with a clear trend of increasing compensation with experience.
3. **Trends Over Time**: The analysis uncovered trends over time, indicating whether salaries in the field are increasing, stable, or declining, providing a historical perspective on job market conditions.
4. **Guidance for Job Seekers and Employers**: The findings provide valuable insights for job seekers to negotiate better salaries and for employers to ensure competitive compensation packages to attract talent.

**Conclusion**

This project offers a detailed analysis of salary trends within the data science and engineering fields across different countries and experience levels. The use of interactive visuals allows users to explore the data in-depth, making it a powerful tool for decision-making for both job seekers and employers. The analysis not only highlights current market conditions but also provides a foundation for future predictions and strategies in the evolving job market landscape.
